**Short Paragraph::** Graceful degradation and service workers are related to one another because graceful degradation is the ability of an application to provide functionality and neccesary content in all types of systems and browers even when certain functions fail. Likewise, service workers help save essential data locally in your browser and as a result, even when a user is offine and has no internet connection, they are still capable of accessing the application. By having service workers, it allows to have the main, core features of an applicaiton and for a user to use application, even when certain factors are limited, like a reliable internet connection.
